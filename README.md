Can anyone tell what is true and what is fake news anymore? From the weaponisation of Covid-19, to devastating meteors en route to destroy earth, and that notion that Pope Francis endorsed Trump in the US presidential race‚Ä¶

Most fake news, however, is difficult to decipher which has led to many people airing on the side of caution and / or increasing their deep mistrust of the media.

Approximately 45% of adults in the UK believe they see or read fake news everyday (JournoLink, 2022).

Definition of fake news: 

    ‚Äòfalse stories that appear to be news, spread on the internet or using other media, usually created to influence political views or as a joke' - Cambridge Dictionary

The reported effects of fake news includes: distrust in the media, the democratic process being undermined, increases in conspiracy theories and hate speech, and the general spread of false information to the detriment of public safety. 

Therefore, we aim to build a supervised machine learning model using Natural Language Programming to predict whether news is real or fake.

### Back-End Tools:

Data Preprocessing 
‚óè	Python
‚óè	Pandas

Machine Learning 
‚óè	Supervised machine learning with Natural Language Programming (Natural Language Understanding) and BERT. 

### Front-End & Data Visualisation:

Web Design Structure
‚óè	HTML
‚óè	CSS (inc. Bootstrap) 

Data Visualisations
‚óè	D3
‚óè	Plotly Express
‚óè	Matplotlib 

Storytelling 
‚óè	Scrollama (JS library)
													  
Implications for Research:
If fake news could be distinguished from real news then the spread of misinformation would reduce. It would also have positive ramifications for democratic processes, the spread of hate speech, and public safety.
