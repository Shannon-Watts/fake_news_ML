# Real or Fake News? A Supervised Machine Learning with Natural Language Processing ðŸ§ 

Can anyone tell what is true and what is fake news anymore? From the weaponisation of Covid-19, to devastating meteors en route to destroy earth, and that notion that Pope Francis endorsed Trump in the US presidential raceâ€¦

Most fake news, however, is difficult to decipher which has led to many people airing on the side of caution and / or increasing their deep mistrust of the media.

Approximately 45% of adults in the UK believe they see or read fake news everyday (JournoLink, 2022).

Definition of fake news: 

    â€˜false stories that appear to be news, spread on the internet or using other media, usually created to influence political views or as a joke' - Cambridge Dictionary

The reported effects of fake news includes: distrust in the media, the democratic process being undermined, increases in conspiracy theories and hate speech, and the general spread of false information to the detriment of public safety. 

Therefore, we aim to build a supervised machine learning model using Natural Language Programming to predict whether news is real or fake.
